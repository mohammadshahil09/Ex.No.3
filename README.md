# ðŸ“‘ Scenario-Based Report: Prompt Engineering Techniques Applied to Software/Website Reactions

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction

In prompt engineering, the phrasing and structure of a prompt greatly influence the response generated by an AI system. This report demonstrates four prompting strategiesâ€”Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Missing Word Prompting, and Preceding Question Promptingâ€”applied to the real-world scenario:
**"How the software or website reacts to the user's action."**

---

## 1. Straightforward Prompting

**Prompt:**
*"Explain what happens when a user clicks the 'Login' button on a website."*

**Output:**

* The system validates entered credentials.
* If correct â†’ redirects to dashboard.
* If incorrect â†’ displays error message *"Invalid username or password"*.



---

## 2. Tabular Format Prompting

**Prompt:**
*"Present in a table how websites react to different user actions such as Login, Search, and Add to Cart."*

**Output (Table):**

| User Action                               | System/Website Reaction                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Clicks "Login"                            | Redirects to dashboard or shows error message |
| Enters text in search bar & presses Enter | Displays search results or "No results found" |
| Clicks "Add to Cart"                      | Adds item to cart and updates cart icon       |
| Hovers over navigation                    | Expands dropdown menu                         |

## 3. Missing Word Prompting

**Prompt:**
*"When a user clicks 'Forgot Password', the website \_\_\_\_\_\_."*

**Output:**

* Sends a password reset link to the registered email.
* Redirects to password recovery page.
* May ask for security verification before proceeding.



---

## 4. Preceding Question Prompting

**Prompt:**
*"What usually happens when a user types in the search bar? Now, explain specifically what happens after they press 'Enter'."*

**Output:**

* Initially, the system records the typed query.
* After pressing Enter:

  * The backend queries the database.
  * Results are retrieved and displayed.
  * If no results, a *"No results found"* message appears.

*

## ðŸ”¹ Comparative Analysis

* **Straightforward Prompting** â†’ Quick, direct responses.
* **Tabular Prompting** â†’ Useful for multiple cases in one view.
* **Missing Word Prompting** â†’ Great for training/learning exercises.
* **Preceding Question Prompting** â†’ Encourages layered, step-by-step answers.

âœ… This report demonstrates how varying the **prompt style** affects the **depth, structure, and clarity** of AI-generated outputs for the same scenario.

Would you like me to **generate custom diagrams (instead of placeholder images from web)** showing user-action â†’ system-reaction flows for each technique? That way the report will have original images tailored exactly to your scenario.



# Result: 
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully .
